Step 2: The application ensures all ongoing key press actions are completed before stopping.
Advanced Mode:

Step 1: Click the "Switch to Advanced Mode" button to enable advanced mode.
Step 2: In advanced mode, you can add precision timing (in milliseconds) to your key actions for finer control.
Exiting the Application:

Step 1: Click the close button (X) on the window.
Step 2: The application will automatically stop all key press actions before closing to ensure no unwanted key presses continue.
Safety Features:
Maximum Limits:
Up to 10 key actions can be added.
Maximum hold duration is 10 seconds.
Maximum interval between key presses is 10 seconds.
Error Handling:

Example Use Case:
Imagine you need to automate a repetitive task in a game where you have to press the 'A' key for 2 seconds, wait for 3 seconds, and then press the 'B' key for 1 second. Here's how you would set it up in AutoKeyHolder:

Add a key action for 'A' with a hold duration of 2 seconds and an interval of 3 seconds.
Add another key action for 'B' with a hold duration of 1 second and an interval of 3 seconds.
Optionally, set the sequence to repeat the desired number of times.
Start the automation and let AutoKeyHolder handle the rest.
AutoKeyHolder is designed to be a simple yet powerful tool for anyone needing to automate key presses on their computer. With its user-friendly interface and robust feature set, it aims to make repetitive tasks easier and more efficient.
